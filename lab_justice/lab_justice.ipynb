    "We plan on continuing to explore simulation in Python this week. However, this time, we're going to simulate some **real-world events** that have actually happened in the past.  The goal is for you to see how we can use data science to think about issues of **equity** and **social justice**.  As usual, in addition to coding, we want you to get practice having **discussions about the data science** you're doing and think about how data science can be a useful tool that can help you in your future job and as a citizen.\n",

The Supreme Court has said that juries must be drawn from a representative cross-section of the community. In other words, juries should be **randomly selected** from the eligible population. However, there are many instances in history where it doesn‚Äôt seem like this was the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take for example, the case of Berghuis v. Smith.  In 1993, Smith (a Black man) was convicted of 2nd-degree murder by an **all-white** jury and sentenced to life in prison. The jury was selected from a panel of about 100 randomly selected people. Only 3 of them were Black and none of those 3 made it into the final 37 considered for Smith‚Äôs trial. The county population was approximately 8 percent Black at the time of the trial.  Remember, jury panels are supposed to be selected at random from the eligible population.\n",
